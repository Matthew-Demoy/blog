Phase 1 - Super beginner

1. Study the most common words ([Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/index.html))([Refold Decks](https://refold.la/category/decks/)) - Goal is to associate in your mind symbols/objects to their utterance in the target language.
2. Pass over the alphabet and phonetics for awareness. More intense study if the alphabet is entirely foreign to your native language
3. Collect and consume audio + visual + subtitled media in the language you find interesting. Similarly to phonetics we are seeing what our brain picks up for free through curiosity. Notice patterns and frequent words. Notice the contexts that the common words are used in.

Feel free to look things up out of curiosity but know that doing this process via translators and searching in native language is memorization through our native language which is not our ultimate method of language acquisition

Move onto the next when the common words starts to become stale/a feeling of mastery over this task

Phase 2 - Beginner

1. Sentence Mine more words, phrases and symbols. Enjoyment is paramount. Also we want to learn what we encounter frequently.
2. Listen to already consumed content to practice comprehension and listening
3. Grab an introductory Spanish text book[[1](https://www.amazon.com/Tu-Diras-Activities-Manual-3rd/dp/083845223X)][[2](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/colloquial/language/spanish.php)] to start learning words in themes and some grammar. Feel free to do the inter-chapter exercises(end of chapter is optional) and mine key information into your SRS

Phase 3 - Upper Beginner

1. Continue to sentence mine
2. Find a place to express yourself. Wether it is a class, journal or pen pal we can start playing with communicating using our basic Spanish. The conversations will feel intimidating and dry but it will direct yourself to low hanging fruit that will improve your day to day vocabulary, listening skills and pronunciation. I recommend a paid teacher as exchange partners on language exchange apps or a personal basis can be inconsistent. Even a mediocre teacher will provide plenty of immediate improvements to your Spanish skills. Just like any hobby learning a language requires discomfort. This is another step of discomfort we need to embrace to 
3. Continue studying the text book

Phase 4 - Intermediate

1. Talk more, Listen more, Study more

Phase 5 - Advanced

I’ll let you guys know once I get there
