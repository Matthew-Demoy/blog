StarkNet a layer 2 blockchain while having superior/even technology in production to Solana has a fraction of attention and volume. Some would argue it is their lack of business development or understanding of crypto culture. While this is true if you look at how StarkNet is treated as an Isreally project we get to the root of what is happening.
