The status quo exists to be broken. What is generally excepted has no merit beyond the value it has provided thus far. If something is better use that. Believe there is something better


The information flow of business and commercial technology run on strong opinions that are weakly held. 

Only novel invention can be seen as truth. 

With no momentum it is easy to identify false positives and difficult to find true positives. When a true positive emerges true negatives are difficult to distinguish from truth.
